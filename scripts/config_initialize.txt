# These are custominstallerbuilder's dependencies. They are essentially 
# everything that is required to build a Seattle base installer (including 
# support for RepyV1 and RepyV2, a nodemanager, Affix, and a softwareupdater).
#
# Note that there is no config_build.txt, as build.py can't currently be 
# used to build a base installer, as this requires copying stuff to 
# subdirectories of the target dir.
#
# See the installation instructions at
